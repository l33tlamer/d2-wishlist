# DIM Wishlists

Just a few wishlists for use with [Destiny Item Manager (DIM)](https://destinyitemmanager.com/) for the game [Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny).

Created with https://wishlists.littlelight.club/ and https://data.destinysets.com/

# Usage:

Browse this repo and find a file of a wishlist you want to use, select "Raw" view, then copy the link to that.

Inside DIM, open the sidebar menu, select "Wish List", then paste URL into the field and add it.

DIM will check periodically for updates of the source file from here.

# Note:

Do not take this as serious recommendations for god-rolls of items, this is just a playground for myself.
